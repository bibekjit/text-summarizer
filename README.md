# text-summarizer 
The text_summarizer.py uses only a .txt file to gather text data and then summarises. Whereas the advanced version also allows users to type the text as well as text via speech .
When the summary is printed, the program reads verbally. People, who are unable to type ( illiterate maybe ) or don't have any sort text file, can use the voice input in order to get the summary.
To run the advanced version in your PC, installing certain libraries is required. Theses libraries aren't easily installable, so I'd recommend that please check for some assistance online. 
For text-to-speech, install pyttsx3 library and for speech-to-text (speech recognition), you need to install 3 or 4 libraries and Microsoft Visual Studios is also required.
