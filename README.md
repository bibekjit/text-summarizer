# text-summarizer 
The text_summarizer.py uses only a .txt file to gather text data and then summarises. Whereas the advanced version also allows users to type the text as well as text via speech .
When the summary is printed, the program reads the it out loud. People, who are unable to type for any reason or don't have any sort of text file, can use the voice input in order to get the summary.
To run the advanced version in your PC, installing certain libraries is required. Theses libraries aren't easily installable, so I'd recommend that please look for some assistance online. 
For text-to-speech, install pyttsx3 library as `pip install pyttsx3` and for speech-to-text (speech recognition), you need to install 3 or 4 libraries and Microsoft Visual Studios is also required.
